  <h1>FireDepartment.net is shutting down</h1>

<p>With great sadness, I have decided to shut down firedepartment.net. Over the last 13 years, I have taken great pleasure in providing this free service to over 8,000 fire departments across the country, helping recruit volunteers, and sharing fire department information with surrounding community members.</p>

<p>Since August of 2021, our revenues have been falling.  On May 25th, Google made an algorithm update that provided a fatal blow to our site and we can no longer afford to cover the expenses of the website.  </p>

<p>I would love to find a way to fund/save the site and bring it back. I welcome your ideas.</p>

<p>To revive the site, I need a minimum operating budget of $5,000/month.</p>

<p>I have a lot going on in my life right now. So, I can’t chase unvetted ideas. If you have a contact who has a specific interest, I would really appreciate your assistance in helping us connect.  </p>

<p>Lastly, I want to thank all the firefighters and fire administrators (both volunteer and paid) who dedicate their lives to keeping our community safe. I also want to thank Meg and Mike for their help in keeping the site running and fire department information up to date.  I couldn’t have done it so long without your help.</p>
